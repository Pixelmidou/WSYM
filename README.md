# WSYM
Here is the live preview of this project : (Temporarily not available) <br>
Current Framework/Third-Party Features in use : PHPMailer - Bootstrap 5 - SCSS - vlucas_phpdotenv - Composer <br><br>
The idea began from a simple school project where my friend an I are going to be testing some security tricks on a simple login panel. <br>
Well that didn't last very long , as the idea quickly escalated to a major project featuring a whole bank system <br><br>
&nbsp; P.S. : <br>
&nbsp; - Sticking to realism is not always easy , so there might be some slips and ommitions <br>
&nbsp; - Making the site totally secure is not easy as well , so in some parts there might be vulnerabilities <br><br>
